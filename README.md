# Reporting bilingualism measures in infant research
The aim of this paper is to provide insight in how biligualism measures have been reported in infant research. A common practice in bilingual language acquisition is to compare a group of bilingual infants with an equivalente group of monolingual peers in one or more dependent variables depending on the selected task, via t-tests, its non-parametric equivalent test or one of the several techniques available for analisis of variance. Given that the outcome of a particular study comparing such groups is strongly influenced by how the groups have been designed (what criteria has been used to consider an infant as monolingual or bilingual), it is critical to 
How do researchers in bilingual language acquisition report the linguistic profile of their samples?

* When the *a posteriori* DoE was reported as an interval (e.g., 95-100%), we counted it as its middle point. In the example provided, we would report 97.5%.
